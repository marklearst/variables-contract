# Variable Contract

A public, tool-agnostic spec and governance rules for design variables: schema, contract, naming, modes, references, and change control.

## Documentation

- Docs live in `docs/`.
- Local site is generated with [docmd](https://github.com/mgks/docmd).

## Local development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run docs:dev
```

## Build

```sh
pnpm run docs:build
```

This generates a static site in `site/`.
