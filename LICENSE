PART II. ADDITIONAL TERMS (STANDARDS INTEGRITY ADDENDUM)
================================================================================

The following additional terms apply to uses of this Specification beyond
personal reference and internal implementation. These terms are designed to
prevent ecosystem fragmentation and protect standards integrity.

By using this Specification in any public-facing capacity, you agree to these
additional terms.

---

## A. DEFINITIONS

"Specification" means the Variables Contract protocol, including all documentation,
JSON schemas, naming conventions, governance rules, architectural patterns, and
code examples published at the Canonical Source.

"Canonical Source" means https://variables-contract.vercel.app

"Synthetic Derivative" means any work produced by inputting the Specification
into a Generative AI system, Large Language Model, or similar automated system
for the purpose of generating rephrased, restructured, or "original" content
that replicates the structure, methodology, or technical approach of the
Specification.

"Conformant Implementation" means software that fully implements the Specification:
Variable Anatomy (Base, Alias, Component), Mode resolution, Reference syntax,
DTCG-aligned JSON structure, and Naming conventions.

---

## B. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

B.1 PUBLIC TOOLING
Any public-facing software claiming compatibility with the Specification must
include attribution visible to end users:

    "Built on the Variables Contract Specification
     https://variables-contract.vercel.app"

B.2 METADATA ATTRIBUTION
JSON files claiming conformance should include:

    "$schema": "https://variables-contract.vercel.app/assets/schema/v1.json"

---

## C. CONFORMANCE CLAIMS

C.1 "VARIABLES CONTRACT CONFORMANT"
To claim conformance, an implementation must:
a. Support full Variable Anatomy (Base, Alias, Component)
b. Support Mode resolution and inheritance
c. Support Reference syntax and resolution
d. Output valid DTCG-aligned JSON with references (not flattened values)
e. Enforce or validate Naming conventions

C.2 "VARIABLES CONTRACT COMPATIBLE"
To claim compatibility, an implementation must:
a. Not corrupt Specification-compliant data
b. Include Attribution per Section B

C.3 FALSE CLAIMS
Claiming conformance or compatibility while failing to meet requirements
constitutes fraud and breach of these terms.

---

## D. PROHIBITED ACTS

D.1 SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVES (AI LAUNDERING)
You may NOT use the Specification as input to AI systems to:
a. Generate competing standards or protocols
b. Produce "original" content replicating the Specification without attribution
c. Create AI training data for generating standards-related content

PERMITTED: Using AI to write code that implements the Specification.
PROHIBITED: Using AI to rewrite or obscure the origin of the Specification.

D.2 COMPETING STANDARDS
You may NOT publish a competing standard incorporating substantial elements
of this Specification without:
a. Written permission from the Copyright Holder, OR
b. Clear attribution linking to the Canonical Source

D.3 FALSE COMPATIBILITY
You may NOT market a tool as "Variables Contract compatible" if it:
a. Omits required structural elements (Anatomy, Modes, References)
b. Outputs non-conformant data (flattened hex values instead of references)
c. Contradicts the governance principles of the Specification

D.4 NAME MISAPPROPRIATION
You may NOT use "Variables Contract" or "VCSL" to imply endorsement or
affiliation without written permission.

---

## E. ENFORCEMENT

E.1 AUTOMATIC TERMINATION
Your rights under this license terminate immediately upon:
a. Creating or distributing a Synthetic Derivative
b. Publishing a Competing Standard without permission/attribution
c. Making false conformance claims
d. Misappropriating the Variables Contract name

E.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION
Upon termination:
a. All rights cease immediately
b. Continued use constitutes copyright infringement
c. You must cease all public conformance claims

E.3 NO AUTOMATIC REINSTATEMENT
Termination is not cured by ceasing violation. Reinstatement requires
written permission from the Copyright Holder.

E.4 RESERVED RIGHTS
The Copyright Holder reserves the right to:
a. Publicly identify non-conformant implementations
b. Issue takedown requests to platforms hosting infringing content
c. Pursue legal remedies for infringement or misrepresentation
d. Request evidence of independent development where substantial
similarity exists

---

## F. NO TRADEMARK GRANT

This license grants no trademark rights. "Variables Contract" may only be used
for truthful conformance statements per Section C.

---

## G. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF
THE SPECIFICATION.
