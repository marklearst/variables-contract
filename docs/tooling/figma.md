# Governance - Figma Workflow

This doc covers Figma-specific guidance for using design tokens in design work.

For the full Tokens Studio operating model, see:

- [Tokens Studio](../tokens-studio)

## Figma rules

1. Designers should apply semantic alias tokens for UI intent.
2. Avoid duplicating raw values in components when a token exists.
3. Token changes should be reviewed and merged via the repo token JSON.
4. Modes should be limited and intentional (example: `light`, `dark`).
5. Token names must follow the naming convention.
